# Flow Engineering

## History

Flow Engineering is a term that originated in fluid dynamics, but I began using it to refer to improving work, data, and information flow in early 2019. The first public use seems to be a talk submitted to All Day DevOps in 2019 (which wasn't accepted):

> Flow Engineering - Boost velocity, quality and happiness in a few hours
Description
How can you make time for real innovation and improvement? How do you know what to automate? How do you escape process prison? How can you get everyone aligned to make a difference? How can you show your team how much better things could be?

Flow Engineering builds on Value Stream Mapping as a framework of techniques you can use right now, with materials you already have - to discover opportunities, build and share your vision and save hours of toil every week so you can invest in what's next.

Sprinkle it on your:
- Delivery/Data/Testing/Analytics/Logging Pipeline
- Developer/Customer Onboarding
- Environment Provisioning
- Failure Recovery/Incident Management/Support Triage
- SDLC
- Toil/Process of choice, you get it :)
…and start spending more time on what's next

I’ve started using Flow Engineering after years of struggling to find time for innovation, rally buy-in, optimize processes and communicate ideas, issues, and risks. It has helped me many times go from tearing my hair out (and I have the baldness to prove it!) to knowing exactly how to level up.

I structure the talk as a fun, story-based journey through enterprise IT, financial services, and a startup or two to share this powerful tool that gets incredible results. Attendees will get a link to all my materials and free examples to get started right away.

### 4 Maps

Initially, Flow Engineering was just a way I referred to my style of creating and applying simple value stream maps, and eventually grew to incorporate 3 more primary maps as well as ultimately a roadmap for improvement implementation.



It became associated with the 4 maps: Outcome, Value Stream, Dependency and Capability in late 2020 in a series of LinkedIn posts to get feedback on the idea, and initially
